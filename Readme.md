A very simple Naive Bayesian Classification implementation.

I wanted to do some document classification, and looking around at the various options I figured I'd come to grips with it better if I rolled my own.

I did take a lot of inspiration from [Burak Kanber's post here](https://burakkanber.com/blog/machine-learning-naive-bayes-1/) and a little bit from [nBayes](https://github.com/joelmartinez/nBayes).
